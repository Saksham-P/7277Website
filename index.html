	<p>Through the Robotics Team, students are able to participate in creating a robot, collaborating with a team, and building relationships. Depending on the ability of a student in a certain field, students can participate in designing a robot, creating electrical circuits, building a robot, programming a robot, conducting the business of the team, as well as many other fields of work. After having worked in Team 7277, students will emerge with additional experience and skills in the field they participated in which will greatly aid students moving forwards towards post-secondary studies.</p>

<div id="imgl2">
	<p>As a grade 10, students can join one of the school’s FIRST Technology Challenge (FTC) Teams which compete against teams across the province in a unique event each year. Those teams focus on developing foundational skills around teamwork, programming, electronics, and mechanics with an eye on moving students on to the school’s FRC program Team 7277. More information on FTC can be found <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<h2>ROBOTICS TEAM</h2>
		<p>Team 7277 typically competes each year in the Canadian Rockies Regional Competition which Nelson Mandela High School has had the honor of hosting in both 2018 and 2019. In that competition students from all across the world come to tournaments to compete against each other in that year’s robotics challenge. In 2019 the Canadian Rockies Regional featured teams from across western Canada competing with teams from California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mexico, China, Turkey, and Australia.<br><br>
		In addition to their work in the robotics arena the Nelson Mandela Robotics Team also works to mentor students at other schools through their outreach to the FIRST Technology Challenge teams at Crossing Park, Ted Harrison, Peter Lougheed, and Terry Fox Schools.</p>
